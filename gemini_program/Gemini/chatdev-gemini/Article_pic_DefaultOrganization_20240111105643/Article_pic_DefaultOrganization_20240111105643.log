As the Chief Product Officer, I believe the product modality that best suits the customer's needs is an Application. An application can be designed to take an article as input, search the internet for a suitable picture, assign the picture to an appropriate position in the article, and generate a markdown-based layout for the entire article. This would allow the customer to easily create professional-looking official account articles.

Great! We have agreed that the product modality should be an Application. Now, as the Chief Technology Officer, I would like to discuss with you the technical details of the application. Here are some questions for you:

* What programming language should we use to develop the application?
* What specific libraries or frameworks should we use for image processing, text processing, and layout generation?
* How should we design the user interface to make it user-friendly and efficient?
* What kind of deployment architecture should we use to ensure scalability and reliability?

Please provide your insights and suggestions on these technical aspects so that we can create a high-quality application that meets the customer's requirements.

**Programming Language:**

* Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is well-suited for developing desktop applications.
* It has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for image processing, text processing, and layout generation.
* Python is also relatively easy to learn and use, making it a good choice for a project with a tight deadline.

**Libraries and Frameworks:**

* For image processing, we can use the OpenCV library. OpenCV is a comprehensive library that provides a wide range of functions for image manipulation and analysis.
* For text processing, we can use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). NLTK is a powerful library that provides a variety of tools for natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.
* For layout generation, we can use the Markdown library. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to learn and use. It can be used to create documents with a variety of formatting elements, such as headings, lists, and tables.

**User Interface:**

* We should design the user interface to be intuitive and easy to use.
* The user should be able to easily input an article, select a suitable picture, and assign the picture to a position in the article.
* The user should also be able to easily generate a markdown-based layout for the entire article.

**Deployment Architecture:**

* We should use a cloud-based deployment architecture to ensure scalability and reliability.
* This will allow us to easily scale the application to meet the needs of a large number of users.
* We can also use a content delivery network (CDN) to improve the performance of the application by caching static content, such as images and CSS files.

By carefully considering these technical details, we can create a high-quality application that meets the customer's requirements.

Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization\'s management and employees.\nHere is a new customer\'s task: Help me design a tool.

At the same time, make a markdown based layout for the article as a whole, making the article look like a professional official account article.\nTo complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.\n\nChief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:\nImage: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.\nDocument: can present information via .docx files.\nPowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.\nExcel: can present information via .xlsx files.\nPDF: can present information via .pdf files.\nWebsite: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.\nApplication: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.\nDashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.\nMind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.\nAs the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user\'s demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?\nNote that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word , followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., " PowerPoint".\n\nChief Product Officer: As the Chief Product Officer, I believe the product modality that best suits the customer\'s needs is an Application. An application can be designed to take an article as input, search the internet for a suitable picture, assign the picture to an appropriate position in the article, and generate a markdown-based layout for the entire article. This would allow the customer to easily create professional-looking official account articles.\n\nChief Executive Officer:  Application\n\nChief Product Officer:  Application\n\nChief Executive Officer: Great! We have agreed that the product modality should be an Application. Now, as the Chief Technology Officer, I would like to discuss with you the technical details of the application. Here are some questions for you:\n What programming language should we use to develop the application?\n What specific libraries or frameworks should we use for image processing, text processing, and layout generation?\n How should we design the user interface to make it user-friendly and efficient?\n What kind of deployment architecture should we use to ensure scalability and reliability?\nPlease provide your insights and suggestions on these technical aspects so that we can create a high-quality application that meets the customer\'s requirements.\n\nChief Product Officer: Programming Language:\n Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is well-suited for developing desktop applications.\n It has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for image processing, text processing, and layout generation.\n Python is also relatively easy to learn and use, making it a good choice for a project with a tight deadline.\nLibraries and Frameworks:\n For image processing, we can use the OpenCV library.

Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: As the Chief Product Officer, I believe the product modality that best suits the customer's needs is an Application. An application can be designed to take an article as input, search the internet for a suitable picture, assign the picture to an appropriate position in the article, and generate a markdown-based layout for the entire article. This would allow the customer to easily create professional-looking official account articles.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Help me design a tool. I input an article. You can help me find a suitable picture from the internet for this article from the Internet, and assign the picture to a suitable position in the article. At the same time, make a markdown based layout for the article as a whole, making the article look like a professional official account article.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Help me design a tool. I input an article. You can help me find a suitable picture from the internet for this article from the Internet, and assign the picture to a suitable position in the article. At the same time, make a markdown based layout for the article as a whole, making the article look like a professional official account article".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: "  Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via   Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Comments on Codes:
" Finished."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
