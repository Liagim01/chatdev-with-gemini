[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a Tetris game..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a Tetris game.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: "  Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via   Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

```LANGUAGE

FILENAME

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Here's an example for the code format

```python

main.py

'''

This a function for main.py

'''

def main():

window = tk.Tk()

#rest of the code that you need to write

if __name__ == "__main__":

 main()

```

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
```LANGUAGE
FILENAME
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
Here's an example for the code format
```python
main.py
'''
This a function for main.py
'''
def main():
window = tk.Tk()
#rest of the code that you need to write
if __name__ == "__main__":

```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
```LANGUAGE
FILENAME
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
Here's an example for the code format
```python
main.py
'''
This a function for main.py
'''
def main():
window = tk.Tk()
#rest of the code that you need to write
if __name__ == "__main__":
 main()
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
```LANGUAGE
FILENAME
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
Here's an example for the code format
```python
main.py
'''
This a function for main.py
'''
def main():
window = tk.Tk()
#rest of the code that you need to write
if __name__ == "__main__":
 main()
```

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

# Tetris Game User Manual

## Introduction

Tetris is a classic puzzle game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. The goal of the game is to stack falling blocks in such a way that they form complete horizontal lines. When a line is completed, it disappears and the blocks above it fall down. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

## Installation

To install Tetris, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can install Tetris using the following command:

```
pip install tetris
```

## How to Play

To play Tetris, you will need to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the falling blocks left and right. You can also use the spacebar to drop the blocks faster.

The game starts with a random block falling from the top of the screen. You can move the block left or right by pressing the left or right arrow keys. You can also rotate the block by pressing the up arrow key.

Once you have positioned the block where you want it, you can drop it by pressing the spacebar. The block will then fall to the bottom of the screen. If the block lands on top of other blocks in such a way that it completes a horizontal line, the line will disappear and the blocks above it will fall down.

The game continues until the blocks reach the top of the screen. If this happens, the game is over.

## Scoring

You score points in Tetris by completing horizontal lines. The more lines you complete, the more points you will score. You also get bonus points for completing multiple lines at once.

## Tips for Playing Tetris

Here are a few tips for playing Tetris:

* Try to keep the blocks as low as possible on the screen. This will give you more time to react to the falling blocks.
* Try to complete multiple lines at once. This will give you more points and help you to clear the screen faster.
* Be careful not to let the blocks reach the top of the screen. If this happens, the game is over.

## Conclusion

Tetris is a classic puzzle game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. With a little practice, you can become a Tetris expert and enjoy hours of fun.
