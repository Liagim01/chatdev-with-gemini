# Tetris Game User Manual

## Introduction

Tetris is a classic puzzle game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. The goal of the game is to stack falling blocks in such a way that they form complete horizontal lines. When a line is completed, it disappears and the blocks above it fall down. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

## Installation

To install Tetris, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can install Tetris using the following command:

```
pip install tetris
```

## How to Play

To play Tetris, you will need to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the falling blocks left and right. You can also use the spacebar to drop the blocks faster.

The game starts with a random block falling from the top of the screen. You can move the block left or right by pressing the left or right arrow keys. You can also rotate the block by pressing the up arrow key.

Once you have positioned the block where you want it, you can drop it by pressing the spacebar. The block will then fall to the bottom of the screen. If the block lands on top of other blocks in such a way that it completes a horizontal line, the line will disappear and the blocks above it will fall down.

The game continues until the blocks reach the top of the screen. If this happens, the game is over.

## Scoring

You score points in Tetris by completing horizontal lines. The more lines you complete, the more points you will score. You also get bonus points for completing multiple lines at once.

## Tips for Playing Tetris

Here are a few tips for playing Tetris:

* Try to keep the blocks as low as possible on the screen. This will give you more time to react to the falling blocks.
* Try to complete multiple lines at once. This will give you more points and help you to clear the screen faster.
* Be careful not to let the blocks reach the top of the screen. If this happens, the game is over.

## Conclusion

Tetris is a classic puzzle game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. With a little practice, you can become a Tetris expert and enjoy hours of fun.
