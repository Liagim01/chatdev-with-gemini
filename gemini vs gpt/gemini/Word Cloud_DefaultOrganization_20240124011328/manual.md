# WordCloud Generator User Manual

## Introduction

The WordCloud Generator is a Python program that generates a word cloud from input text. The program accepts text input from the user and processes the input to create a word cloud visualization. You can use libraries like wordcloud in combination with matplotlib or another suitable visualization library for this task. The user should be prompted to enter the text, and the program should then process the text to create a word cloud. You can customize the appearance of the word cloud, such as choosing the color scheme, size, and font. The word cloud should accurately represent the frequency of words in the input text, with more frequent words appearing larger in the visualization. Ensure that your program has a user-friendly interface that guides the user through the process of entering text and customizing the word cloud's appearance. Test your program with various input texts to verify that it generates meaningful word clouds.
