Excellent choice! An Application would be a great way to bring this task to life. With Python, we can create a visually appealing and engaging game that users of all ages can enjoy. We can also incorporate different levels of difficulty to keep users challenged and entertained.

Here are some additional thoughts on how we can make this Application a success:

* We should make sure the game is easy to learn and play, with intuitive controls and a clear objective.
* We can include different types of raindrops, each with its own unique properties, to add variety and challenge to the game.
* We can also add power-ups and bonuses to help players progress through the game and achieve a higher score.
* To make the game more social, we can include leaderboards and achievements that players can share with their friends.

I am confident that, by working together, we can create an Application that is both fun and educational, and that will be enjoyed by users of all ages.

Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:
Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.
Document: can present information via .docx files.
PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.
Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.

Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.
Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: I suggest we create an Application for this task, as it allows for a visualized game to be implemented via Python, which would be a fun and interactive way for users to engage with the task.

Chief Executive Officer: <INFO> Application

Chief Product Officer: Excellent choice! An Application would be a great way to bring this task to life. With Python, we can create a visually appealing and engaging game that users of all ages can enjoy. We can also incorporate different levels of difficulty to keep users challenged and entertained.
Here are some additional thoughts on how we can make this Application a success:
* We should make sure the game is easy to learn and play, with intuitive controls and a clear objective.
* We can include different types of raindrops, each with its own unique properties, to add variety and challenge to the game.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via   Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Comments on Codes:
" Finished."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
```LANGUAGE
FILENAME
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
Here's an example for the code format
```python
main.py
'''
This a function for main.py
'''
def main():
window = tk.Tk()
#rest of the code that you need to write
if __name__ == "__main__":
 main()
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
```LANGUAGE
FILENAME
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
Here's an example for the code format
```python
main.py
'''
This a function for main.py
'''
def main():
window = tk.Tk()
#rest of the code that you need to write
if __name__ == "__main__":
 main()
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Comments on Codes:
" Finished."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
```LANGUAGE
FILENAME
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
Here's an example for the code format
```python
main.py
'''
This a function for main.py
'''
def main():
window = tk.Tk()
#rest of the code that you need to write
if __name__ == "__main__":
 main()
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.
