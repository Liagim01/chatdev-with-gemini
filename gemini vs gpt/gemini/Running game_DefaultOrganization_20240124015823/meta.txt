Task:
Please design a running game for me. It's a simple, endless game. It features a 2D side-scrolling interface, showcasing a pixelated block as the main character. Players initiate the game by pressing the spacebar, making the block start running on the ground. Obstacles such as pixel blocks appear randomly, which players avoid by pressing the spacebar to jump. There is no end to the game; players aim to survive as long as possible and achieve high scores, which are displayed on an on-screen counter. In the event of a collision with an obstacle, the game ends, displaying a 'Game Over' panel, after which players can restart.
