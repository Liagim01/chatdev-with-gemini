We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

The main file sets up the game, handles user input, updates the game objects, checks for collisions, and draws the game objects on the screen. The Bird class represents the player-controlled bird, and the Pipe class represents the obstacles in the game.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the `pygame` module in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to add the following import statement at the beginning of the file:

```python
import pygame
```

This will ensure that the `pygame` module is available for use in the code.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method in the `Bird` and `Pipe` classes. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.

Once you have made these changes, the code should be ready to run.

This will ensure that the `pygame` module is available for use in the code.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method in the `Bird` and `Pipe` classes. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.

Once you have made these changes, the code should be ready to run.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the `pygame` module in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to add the following import statement at the beginning of the file:

```python
import pygame
```

This will ensure that the `pygame` module is available for use in the code.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each method in the `Bird` and `Pipe` classes. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.

Once you have made these changes, the code should be ready to run."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the `pygame` module in the `main.py` file. To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
import pygame
```

This will ensure that the `pygame` module is properly imported and can be used throughout the code.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each class and method. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for both the developers and future maintainers.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready for execution.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code is missing the necessary import statements for the `pygame` module in the `main.py` file. To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the `main.py` file:

```python
import pygame
```

This will ensure that the `pygame` module is properly imported and can be used throughout the code.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each class and method. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for both the developers and future maintainers.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready for execution."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the Bird and Pipe classes in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from bird import Bird
from pipe import Pipe
```

This will allow the main.py file to access the Bird and Pipe classes and use them in the game.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the main.py file explaining the purpose of each section of code, such as initializing the game, setting up the display, and handling the game loop. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready to run and the Flappy Bird game should function as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the Bird and Pipe classes in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from bird import Bird
from pipe import Pipe
```

This will allow the main.py file to access the Bird and Pipe classes and use them in the game.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the main.py file explaining the purpose of each section of code, such as initializing the game, setting up the display, and handling the game loop. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready to run and the Flappy Bird game should function as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation
