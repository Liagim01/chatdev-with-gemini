Given the task at hand, which is to design a pingpong game, the most suitable product modalities from our repertoire would be either an Application or a Website. Both modalities allow for interactive elements and can support the dynamic nature of a game.

An Application would be a standalone program that users can download and install on their devices. It would provide a controlled environment for the game and could be optimized for performance. However, it would require compatibility considerations for different operating systems.

A Website, on the other hand, would be accessible via web browsers, making it platform-independent. It could reach a wider audience without the need for installation. However, it might be slightly less performant compared to a native application, depending on the complexity of the game and the technologies used.

Considering these points, we should decide which modality aligns best with our customer's needs and our capabilities. What are your thoughts on this?

Given the nature of the task to design a pingpong game, I would lean towards the Application modality. This is because a standalone application can be optimized for performance, which is crucial for a game that requires real-time interactions and quick response times. Additionally, an application can be designed to work offline, ensuring that users can play the game without an internet connection.

While a Website is more accessible and easier to distribute, the potential performance trade-off might not be ideal for a game like pingpong, where lag or delay can significantly impact the user experience. Moreover, an application can be designed to offer a more immersive experience with better control over graphics and user input.

Considering our mission of 'changing the digital world through programming' and our ability to create visually appealing and high-performance software, I believe an Application would be the most suitable product modality for the pingpong game. What are your thoughts on this, and do you agree with the Application modality?

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: design a pingpong game.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "design a pingpong game".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To design a pingpong game in Python with a graphical user interface, we'll use the Pygame library, which is suitable for creating games with simple 2D graphics. We'll create a basic pingpong game where two players can control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

Let's outline the core components of the game:

1. `Game`: The main class to control game flow and states.
2. `Paddle`: A class to represent a player's paddle.
3. `Ball`: A class to represent the pingpong ball.
4. `main`: The main function to initialize the game and start the game loop.

We will have one main file named `pingpong.py`.

pingpong.py

```python

This is the main file for the pingpong game designed using Pygame. It contains the game loop, event handling, and rendering of game objects.

# Main function
def main():
    game = Game()
    game.run()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To run this game, you would need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

After installing Pygame, you can run the `pingpong.py` file to start the game. The controls for the left paddle are 'W' (up) and 'S' (down), and for the right paddle, the arrow keys 'UP' and 'DOWN' are used. The ball will bounce off the walls and paddles, and the game will continue indefinitely until the window is closed.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: design a pingpong game.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code for the pingpong game, the highest priority comment is related to the installation command provided within the Python script. The line `pip install pygame` should not be included in the `.py` file as it is not executable Python code but rather a command-line instruction to install the Pygame library.

Here's the suggestion on how to fix this issue:

1. Remove the following lines from the `.py` file:

```python
pip install pygame
```

2. Instead, provide the installation instruction separately in a `README.md` file or as a comment in the main script. For example, you can include the following at the top of `main.py` as a comment:

```python
# Before running this game, make sure to install Pygame by running 'pip install pygame' in your command line or terminal.
```

3. Ensure that the installation instructions are clear and accessible to the user, so they can set up their environment correctly before running the game.

Additionally, while this is the highest priority comment, it's worth noting that the code could be further improved by adding comments to the methods within the classes to explain their functionality, as per regulation 3. This would make the code more understandable and maintainable.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code for the pingpong game, the highest priority comment is related to the installation command provided within the Python script. The line `pip install pygame` should not be included in the `.py` file as it is not executable Python code but rather a command-line instruction to install the Pygame library.

Here's the suggestion on how to fix this issue:

1. Remove the following lines from the `.py` file:

```python
pip install pygame
```

2. Instead, provide the installation instruction separately in a `README.md` file or as a comment in the main script. For example, you can include the following at the top of `main.py` as a comment:

```python
# Before running this game, make sure to install Pygame by running 'pip install pygame' in your command line or terminal.
```

3. Ensure that the installation instructions are clear and accessible to the user, so they can set up their environment correctly before running the game.

Additionally, while this is the highest priority comment, it's worth noting that the code could be further improved by adding comments to the methods within the classes to explain their functionality, as per regulation 3. This would make the code more understandable and maintainable."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Remove the following lines from the .py file:\n\npython\npip install pygame\n\n\n2. Instead, provide the installation instruction separately in a README.md file or as a comment in the main script.

Ensure that the installation instructions are clear and accessible to the user, so they can set up their environment correctly before running the game.\n\nAdditionally, while this is the highest priority comment, it's worth noting that the code could be further improved by adding comments to the methods within the classes to explain their functionality, as per regulation 3. This would make the code more understandable and maintainable."} |

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.

Here is a new customer's task: design a pingpong game.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code for the pingpong game, the highest priority comment is related to the ball's movement logic, specifically the condition that reverses the ball's horizontal direction when it reaches the left or right edge of the screen. This logic should be modified to account for scoring rather than bouncing off the edges.

Here's the problematic section of the code:

```python
if self.rect.x <= 0 or self.rect.x >= SCREEN_WIDTH - BALL_SIZE:
    self.speed_x *= -1
```

This code causes the ball to bounce back when it hits the left or right edge, which is not typical behavior for a pingpong game. Instead, the game should register a point for the opposing player and reset the ball to the center.

To fix this, we need to implement a scoring system and reset the ball's position when it goes out of bounds on the left or right side. Here's how you can revise the `Ball` class and `Game` class to include scoring:

1. Add score attributes to the `Game` class:

```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing code ...
        self.score1 = 0
        self.score2 = 0
```

2. Modify the `Ball` class's `move` method to reset the ball and update the score:

```python
class Ball:
    # ... existing code ...
    def move(self, game):
        # ... existing code ...
        if self.rect.x <= 0:
            game.score2 += 1
            self.reset()
        elif self.rect.x >= SCREEN_WIDTH - BALL_SIZE:
            game.score1 += 1
            self.reset()
    
    def reset(self):
        self.rect.x = SCREEN_WIDTH // 2 - BALL_SIZE // 2
        self.rect.y = SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2 - BALL_SIZE // 2
        self.speed_x *= -1  # Optionally, change direction
```

3. Update the `run` method in the `Game` class to pass the `game` instance to the ball's `move` method:

```python
class Game:
    # ... existing code ...
    def run(self):
        # ... existing code ...
        while running:
            # ... existing code ...
            self.ball.move(self)
            # ... existing code ...
```

With these changes, the game will now keep score and reset the ball to the center whenever a player scores a point. Additionally, you might want to display the score on the screen, which would require additional code to render text in Pygame.

            self.reset()
    
    def reset(self):
        self.rect.x = SCREEN_WIDTH // 2 - BALL_SIZE // 2

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code for the pingpong game, the highest priority comment is related to the ball's movement logic, specifically the condition that reverses the ball's horizontal direction when it reaches the left or right edge of the screen. This logic should be modified to account for scoring rather than bouncing off the edges.

Here's the problematic section of the code:

```python
if self.rect.x <= 0 or self.rect.x >= SCREEN_WIDTH - BALL_SIZE:
    self.speed_x *= -1
```

This code causes the ball to bounce back when it hits the left or right edge, which is not typical behavior for a pingpong game. Instead, the game should register a point for the opposing player and reset the ball to the center.

To fix this, we need to implement a scoring system and reset the ball's position when it goes out of bounds on the left or right side. Here's how you can revise the `Ball` class and `Game` class to include scoring:

1. Add score attributes to the `Game` class:

```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing code ...
        self.score1 = 0
        self.score2 = 0
```

2. Modify the `Ball` class's `move` method to reset the ball and update the score:

```python
class Ball:
    # ... existing code ...
    def move(self, game):
        # ... existing code ...
        if self.rect.x <= 0:
            game.score2 += 1
            self.reset()
        elif self.rect.x >= SCREEN_WIDTH - BALL_SIZE:
            game.score1 += 1
            self.reset()
    
    def reset(self):
        self.rect.x = SCREEN_WIDTH // 2 - BALL_SIZE // 2
        self.rect.y = SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2 - BALL_SIZE // 2
        self.speed_x *= -1  # Optionally, change direction
```

3. Update the `run` method in the `Game` class to pass the `game` instance to the ball's `move` method:

```python
class Game:
    # ... existing code ...
    def run(self):
        # ... existing code ...
        while running:
            # ... existing code ...
            self.ball.move(self)
            # ... existing code ...
```

With these changes, the game will now keep score and reset the ball to the center whenever a player scores a point. Additionally, you might want to display the score on the screen, which would require additional code to render text in Pygame."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

This logic should be modified to account for scoring rather than bouncing off the edges.\n\nHere's the problematic section of the code:\n\npython\nif self.rect.x &lt;= 0 or self.rect.x &gt;= SCREEN_WIDTH - BALL_SIZE:\n    self.speed_x *= -1\n\n\nThis code causes the ball to bounce back when it hits the left or right edge, which is not typical behavior for a pingpong game. Instead, the game should register a point for the opposing player and reset the ball to the center.\n\nTo fix this, we need to implement a scoring system and reset the ball's position when it goes out of bounds on the left or right side. Here's how you can revise the Ball class and Game class to include scoring:\n\n1. Add score attributes to the Game class:\n\npython\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # ... existing code ...\n        self.score1 = 0\n        self.score2 = 0\n\n\n2. Modify the Ball class's move method to reset the ball and update the score:\n\npython\nclass Ball:\n    # ... existing code ...\n    def move(self, game):\n        # ... existing code ...\n        if self.rect.x &lt;= 0:\n            game.score2 += 1\n            self.reset()\n        elif self.rect.x &gt;= SCREEN_WIDTH - BALL_SIZE:\n            game.score1 += 1\n            self.reset()\n    \n    def reset(self):\n        self.rect.x = SCREEN_WIDTH // 2 - BALL_SIZE // 2\n        self.rect.y = SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2 - BALL_SIZE // 2\n        self.speed_x *= -1  # Optionally, change direction\n\n\n3. Update the run method in the Game class to pass the game instance to the ball's move method:\n\npython\nclass Game:\n    # ... existing code ...\n    def run(self):\n        # ... existing code ...\n        while running:\n            # ... existing code ...\n            self.ball.move(self)\n            # ... existing code ...\n\n\nWith these changes, the game will now keep score and reset the ball to the center whenever a player scores a point. Additionally, you might want to display the score on the screen, which would require additional code to render text in Pygame."} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: design a pingpong game.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code for the pingpong game, the code generally adheres to the regulations set by ChatDev. However, there is one issue that stands out with the highest priority: the game does not handle the collision between the ball and the paddles correctly. The collision detection is too simplistic and does not account for the direction from which the ball hits the paddle.

Here's the current collision handling method in the `Ball` class:

```python
def collide_with_paddle(self, paddle):
    '''
    Change ball direction if it collides with a paddle.
    '''
    if self.rect.colliderect(paddle.rect):
        self.speed_x *= -1
```

This method simply inverts the `speed_x` of the ball whenever it collides with a paddle, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the ball hits the top or bottom edge of the paddle.

To fix this, we need to enhance the collision detection to consider the position where the ball hits the paddle and then adjust the `speed_x` and `speed_y` accordingly. Here's a suggestion on how to revise the `collide_with_paddle` method:

```python
def collide_with_paddle(self, paddle):
    '''
    Change ball direction if it collides with a paddle, taking into account the position of collision.
    '''
    if self.rect.colliderect(paddle.rect):
        # Check if collision is from top or bottom of the paddle
        if self.rect.centery < paddle.rect.top or self.rect.centery > paddle.rect.bottom:
            self.speed_y *= -1
        else:
            self.speed_x *= -1
        # Optional: Adjust speed_y based on where the ball hits the paddle for more dynamic gameplay
        offset = (paddle.rect.centery - self.rect.centery) / (PADDLE_HEIGHT / 2)
        self.speed_y -= offset
```

This revised method checks whether the collision is from the top or bottom of the paddle and inverts the `speed_y` if that's the case. Otherwise, it inverts the `speed_x`. Additionally, it introduces an optional feature where the `speed_y` is adjusted based on where the ball hits the paddle, which can make the game more interesting and dynamic.

Please implement this change to ensure the collision logic is robust and the gameplay is as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code for the pingpong game, the code generally adheres to the regulations set by ChatDev. However, there is one issue that stands out with the highest priority: the game does not handle the collision between the ball and the paddles correctly. The collision detection is too simplistic and does not account for the direction from which the ball hits the paddle.

Here's the current collision handling method in the `Ball` class:

```python
def collide_with_paddle(self, paddle):
    '''
    Change ball direction if it collides with a paddle.
    '''
    if self.rect.colliderect(paddle.rect):
        self.speed_x *= -1
```

This method simply inverts the `speed_x` of the ball whenever it collides with a paddle, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the ball hits the top or bottom edge of the paddle.

To fix this, we need to enhance the collision detection to consider the position where the ball hits the paddle and then adjust the `speed_x` and `speed_y` accordingly. Here's a suggestion on how to revise the `collide_with_paddle` method:

```python
def collide_with_paddle(self, paddle):
    '''
    Change ball direction if it collides with a paddle, taking into account the position of collision.
    '''
    if self.rect.colliderect(paddle.rect):
        # Check if collision is from top or bottom of the paddle
        if self.rect.centery < paddle.rect.top or self.rect.centery > paddle.rect.bottom:
            self.speed_y *= -1
        else:
            self.speed_x *= -1
        # Optional: Adjust speed_y based on where the ball hits the paddle for more dynamic gameplay
        offset = (paddle.rect.centery - self.rect.centery) / (PADDLE_HEIGHT / 2)
        self.speed_y -= offset
```

This revised method checks whether the collision is from the top or bottom of the paddle and inverts the `speed_y` if that's the case. Otherwise, it inverts the `speed_x`. Additionally, it introduces an optional feature where the `speed_y` is adjusted based on where the ball hits the paddle, which can make the game more interesting and dynamic.

Please implement this change to ensure the collision logic is robust and the gameplay is as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Here is a new customer's task: design a pingpong game.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the provided code for the pingpong game, the only dependency required is `pygame`. The `requirements.txt` file should list `pygame` along with the version that is known to be compatible with the game. If the game has been tested and works with `pygame` version `2.0.1`, then the `requirements.txt` file should specify this version.

Here is the content for the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pygame==2.0.1
```

This file indicates that the `pygame` package must be installed at version `2.0.1` for the game to function as expected. Users or developers can install all the dependencies listed in this file using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command should be run in the terminal or command line in the same directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located.

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided code for the pingpong game, the only dependency required is `pygame`. The `requirements.txt` file should list `pygame` along with the version that is known to be compatible with the game. If the game has been tested and works with `pygame` version `2.0.1`, then the `requirements.txt` file should specify this version.
Here is the content for the `requirements.txt` file:
```

This file indicates that the `pygame` package must be installed at version `2.0.1` for the game to function as expected. Users or developers can install all the dependencies listed in this file using the following command:
```bash

Here is a new customer's task: design a pingpong game.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Executive Officer at ChatDev, I'll provide guidance on how to finalize the `requirements.txt` file for the pingpong game project. The `requirements.txt` file is indeed used to specify the Python packages and their versions that are necessary for a project. This file is crucial for ensuring that the project can be set up with the correct dependencies in different environments, maintaining consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

Based on the code provided by the Chief Technology Officer, the only external dependency required for the pingpong game is `pygame`. The version specified in the code snippet is `2.0.1`, which should be reflected in the `requirements.txt` file.

Here is the content for the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pygame==2.0.1
```

This file will ensure that anyone who wants to run the pingpong game will have the correct version of `pygame` installed. To install the dependencies, the user or developer should navigate to the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file and run the following command in their terminal or command line interface:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install the `pygame` package at version `2.0.1`, which is necessary for the game to run as expected. It's important to note that if any additional dependencies are added to the project in the future, they should also be included in the `requirements.txt` file with their respective version numbers.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

# PingPong Game User Manual

Welcome to the PingPong Game, a classic arcade-style game designed to provide hours of fun and competition. This manual will guide you through the main functions of the software, how to install the necessary environment dependencies, and how to play the game.

## Main Functions of the Software

The PingPong Game is a simple yet engaging game where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The main functions of the game include:

- **Paddle Movement**: Players can move their paddles up and down to intercept the ball.
- **Ball Movement**: The ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the top and bottom edges and the paddles.
- **Scoring**: A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball, and the score is displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Game Reset**: After a point is scored, the ball is reset to the center of the screen to resume play.

## Quick Install

Before you can start playing the PingPong Game, you need to install the Pygame library, which is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library, allowing you real-time control over graphics, sound, and input devices.

### Installing Pygame

To install Pygame, you can use `pip`, which is the package installer for Python. Open your command line or terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame==2.0.1
```

Alternatively, you can install Pygame by using the `requirements.txt` file provided with the game. Navigate to the directory containing `requirements.txt` and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play the PingPong Game

Once you have installed Pygame, you are ready to play the game. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Start the Game**: Run `main.py` to start the game. You can do this by typing `python main.py` in your terminal or command line, assuming you are in the directory where `main.py` is located.

2. **Control the Paddles**: Use the `W` and `S` keys to move the left paddle up and down. Use the `UP ARROW` and `DOWN ARROW` keys to move the right paddle up and down.

3. **Play the Game**: The ball will automatically start moving when the game begins. Each player must move their paddle to hit the ball back to the other side. If the ball passes a paddle and hits the edge of the screen, the opposing player scores a point.

4. **Scoring**: The game keeps track of each player's score, which is displayed at the top of the screen. The game continues indefinitely, so you can set your own winning score or play as long as you like.

5. **Exiting the Game**: To exit the game, simply close the game window or press the `ESC` key.

Enjoy the game and have fun competing with friends or practicing against yourself!

4. **Scoring**: The game keeps track of each player's score, which is displayed at the top of the screen. The game continues indefinitely, so you can set your own winning score or play as long as you like.

5. **Exiting the Game**: To exit the game, simply close the game window or press the `ESC` key.

Enjoy the game and have fun competing with friends or practicing against yourself!
