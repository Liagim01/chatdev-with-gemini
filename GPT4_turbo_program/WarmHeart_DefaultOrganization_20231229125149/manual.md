## Installation

Before you can use the Reminder App, you need to ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The app requires Python version 3.5 or higher.

### Installing Python

If you do not have Python installed, download and install it from the official Python website:

[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Setting Up the Environment

Once Python is installed, you need to install the required dependencies. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the `requirements.txt` file provided with the app.

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
