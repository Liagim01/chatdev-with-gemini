# Tic-Tac-Toe Game User Manual

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game developed by ChatDev! This user-friendly application allows two players to enjoy the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a simple and intuitive interface. Below you will find instructions on how to set up the game environment, install any necessary dependencies, and play the game.

## Installation

Before you can play the game, you need to ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. Python can be downloaded from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can set up the game environment. Open your terminal or command prompt and follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for the game:
   ```
   mkdir TicTacToeGame
   cd TicTacToeGame
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   - Since this game does not require external libraries beyond what is included with Python's standard library, you can skip this step.

## Starting the Game

To start the game, you need to run the `main.py` file. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `main.py` and execute the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The game window should now open, and you are ready to play!

## How to Play

The Tic-Tac-Toe game window consists of a 3x3 grid of buttons and a "Restart Game" button. Here's how to use it:

- The game is played turn by turn, with Player X going first.
- Click on an empty square to place your mark (X or O).
- The game automatically switches turns between Player X and Player O.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
- If all nine squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a tie.
- To start a new game at any point, click the "Restart Game" button.

## Main Functions

- **Interactive Game Board**: Click on the squares to play your turn.
- **Turn Indicator**: The game keeps track of whose turn it is and updates the board accordingly.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects a win or a tie and displays a message to the players.
- **Restart Game**: Allows players to start a new game without closing and reopening the application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while playing the game, please ensure that you are using a supported version of Python (Python 3.x). If the problem persists, feel free to contact ChatDev support for assistance.

Enjoy the game, and may the best player win!
